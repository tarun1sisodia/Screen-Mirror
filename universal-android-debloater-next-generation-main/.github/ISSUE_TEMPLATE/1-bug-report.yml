      Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

      Wherever you see "If relevant", you can omit the field, if you prefer privacy.
      If we believe it's relevant to the bug, we may later ask you to fill the info.

      Examples:
        - If your OS is Windows or Mac, then [WM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager)/[WS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system) and [DE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) are irrelevant, because it's implied by the OS.
        - If the bug is related to ADB, then it's unlikely to be related to GUI, DE, or WM. No need to specify them.
        - If you use the latest-stable official version of any software (such as a [distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)), you can omit the version number.
