# Context for Debloater Android App Development

## Project Overview
The **Universal Android Debloater Next Generation** is a tool designed to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary and obscure system apps. It aims to enhance security by reducing the attack surface of Android devices. The project is a fork of the original Universal Android Debloater (UAD) and is built using Rust.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
universal-android-debloater-next-generation-main/
├── .cargo/                # Cargo configuration and dependencies
├── .github/               # GitHub-related files
├── Cargo.toml             # Project manifest for Rust
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── src/                   # Source code
│   ├── core/              # Core logic for debloating
│   ├── gui/               # GUI components
├── resources/             # Assets, images, and screenshots
└── LICENSE                # Licensing information
```

## Phases of Development
1. **Planning**: Define the features and functionalities of the Flutter app based on the existing Rust application.
2. **Setup**: Create the Flutter project and set up the initial structure.
3. **Core Logic Implementation**: Develop the core logic for listing and debloating applications.
4. **UI Development**: Create user interface components for interacting with the debloating functionality.
5. **Testing**: Test the application on various devices to ensure functionality and performance.
6. **Deployment**: Prepare the app for release on app stores.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Planning and project setup.
- **Week 2-3**: Core logic implementation.
- **Week 4**: UI development.
- **Week 5**: Testing and bug fixing.
- **Week 6**: Deployment preparation.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Create Flutter Project**: Use the command `flutter create debloater_android` to set up the project.
2. **Define Project Structure**: Create directories for `core` and `gui` within the `lib` folder.
3. **Implement Core Logic**:
   - Create `debloater_service.dart` in the `core` directory.
   - Implement methods for listing installed applications and debloating them.
4. **Develop UI Components**:
   - Create `home_page.dart` in the `gui` directory.
   - Design the UI to display installed applications and provide options to debloat.
5. **Integrate Core Logic with UI**: Connect the debloating functionality with the UI components.
6. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing on different devices to ensure compatibility and performance.
7. **Deployment**: Prepare the app for release, including creating necessary app store assets.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a guide for developing the **Debloater Android** app inspired by the **Universal Android Debloater Next Generation** project. By following the outlined phases and steps, we can create a robust application that enhances user privacy and device performance.
